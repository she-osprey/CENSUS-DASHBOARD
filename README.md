# Census Dashboard
## Project Description
The first known population census in Kenya was conducted in 1897 and was basically a headcount. This was followed by the 1948 census that focused on non-natives. A complete census that enumerated 8.6 million persons was conducted in 1962 and was used to set up political and administrative structures. The first post-independence census was undertaken in 1969 and enumerated 10.9 million persons. Since then, the country has conducted decennial Population and Housing Censuses on a de facto basis with the midnight of 24th/25th August as the reference point. The censuses have been implemented in accordance with the United Nations (UN) Principles and Recommendations for conducting population and housing censuses..
2019 KPHC was to collect information on the size, composition, distribution and socio-economic characteristics of the population. 

### The specific objectives were to ascertain the following:
:black_small_square: Population size, composition, and spatial distribution;
:black_small_square: Levels of fertility, mortality and migration;
:black_small_square: Educational attainment;
:black_small_square: Household composition;
:black_small_square: Rate and pattern of urbanization;
:black_small_square: Size and deployment of the labour force;
:black_small_square: Distribution of persons with a disability;
:black_small_square: Housing conditions and availability of household amenities; and
:black_small_square: Agricultural indicators to inform the creation of an agriculture sampling frame

### This information will be used in planning, budgeting and programming for important services; future policy formulation, resource allocation; creation of administrative and
political units; monitoring and evaluation of programmes and projects; research; development of a master household sampling frame; development of geo-spatial database; and benchmark for agricultural census/surveys.  
## Objective: 
Creating a dashboard for the 2019 population and housing Census with a focus on Socio-Economic characteristics
